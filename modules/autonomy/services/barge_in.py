"""Barge-in policy: decide when the user's voice should cut off the robot.

Historically the robot only stopped talking when it heard a wakeword. Natural
conversation also lets you interrupt mid-sentence just by starting to speak.
This controller centralises that decision so it can be unit-tested without any
audio hardware: given (is the robot currently talking?, what did the user say?),
it returns whether to interrupt — with a cooldown so a single utterance doesn't
trigger repeated stops.
